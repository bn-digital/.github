### bn's value pillars

- **The best code is no code at all**
> Itâ€™s painful for most software developers to acknowledge this, because they love code so much, but the best code is no code at all. Every new line of code you willingly bring into the world is code that has to be debugged, code that has to be read and understood, code that has to be supported. Every time you write new code, you should do so reluctantly, under duress, because you completely exhausted all your other options. Code is only our enemy because there are so many of us programmers writing so damn much of it. If you canâ€™t get away with no code, the next best thing is to start with brevity.
As we really love writing code, thats why we writing as little of it as possible.

- **Use open-source software and contribute back**
> Despite the fact that most people would have never predicted that a system based around people working for free would work, open source philosophy is making a big impact. The thing to understand is that open source embraces the philosophy of sharing, and because of this, concepts such as piracy are no longer a problem. You are encouraged to share and spread open source products as much as you like. You can copy and redistribute, even after modification. This provides us a freedom and superpower to create and develop software of any complexity or business domain.
