### bn's engineering pillars

- **The best code is no code at all**
> It's painful for most software developers to acknowledge this because they love code so much, but the best code is no code at all. Every new line of code brought into the world is the code that has to be debugged, read, understood, and supported. Every time we write new code, we do so reluctantly, under duress, because we have exhausted all other options. Code is only our enemy because so many programmers are writing so damn much of it. 

As we really love writing code, that's why we write as little of it as possible.

- **Use open-source software and contribute back**
> Although most people would have never predicted that a system based around people working for free would work, open-source philosophy makes a significant impact. Open source embraces the philosophy of sharing, and because of this, concepts such as piracy are no longer a problem. We are eager to share and spread open source products as much as possible. We encourage others to leverage our experience, copy the code and freely modify it.

This idea provides us with the freedom and superpower to create and develop software of any complexity or business domain. In gratitude, we support the open-source community and share our non-commercial code and knowledge.
